# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Progress
#ARRAYS
## Overview
This repository documents my journey in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with a focus on arrays. The project includes implementations of fundamental array operations and algorithms, providing practical examples and exercises.

## Current Focus: Arrays

### 1. Basic Operations
- **Array Creation and Initialization:** Implemented functions for creating and initializing arrays. This includes handling various data types and array sizes.
- **Input and Output Operations:** Developed methods to handle user input and output for arrays, demonstrating interaction with data.
- **Size Calculation:** Implemented logic to determine the size of an array, ensuring accurate management of array elements.

### 2. Array Manipulation
- **Finding Minimum and Maximum Values:** Created algorithms to find the minimum and maximum values in an array. Useful for understanding basic traversal and comparison.
- **Array Reversal:** Developed a function to reverse the elements of an array in place, showcasing array manipulation techniques.

### 3. Search Algorithms
- **Linear Search:** Implemented a linear search algorithm to find an element in an unsorted array. This method checks each element sequentially.
- **Binary Search:** Developed a binary search algorithm for efficient searching in a sorted array, utilizing a divide-and-conquer approach to improve search performance.
